# The Open Source Guitar Book :guitar:

## Introduction

This book represent my effort to create a comprehensive book about what I have learned during my  journey on the electrical guitar.

I am not a professional player, not a teacher and I haven't any academic background in music. This book is more a collection of notes, notions, exercises and riffs that I found interesting. I am also currently using this as a guidance for teaching myself, so every exercise in this book has been played and tested by me.

**My ultimate goal is to give the opportunity to everyone to learn guitar using a free reference book and spread the passion and love for this great instrument.**

This does not substitute a good teacher or music schools, hopefully this will become a reference book and a place to find practical exercises to improve on the instrument.

The best part of this project is that it is born as free and open source: contributors are encouraged to share their knowledge in this attempt to build a great reference for new and expert guitarists. With everyone's effort this book can be always improved and available to anyone.

The "Open Source Guitar Book" was born from my idea (Alessandro Rossignoli) and desire of being able to structure a complete book with exercises to improve electric guitar playing with my own pace.
This book has been inspired by other great musicians, teachers and books.

One special thanks goes to my all-time favourite guitar hero John Petrucci: with his great work and playing he has motivated me in learning and improving with guitar. He has been such a great inspiration for me in never giving up on guitar and for this idea, to spread the love for this beautiful instrument and give as many people as possible the opportunity to practice and improve.

## Structure

This book for now is just a collection of [Musescore](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) scores that I have organized in different folders to build a book of exercises.
I chose [Musescore](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) because it is an open source project like this one and supports all the music notation that I needed, plus the tab notation.

In the future I am planning to expand this work with an autogenerated web application that can be accessed from desktop PC and mobile, plus a dedicated mobile app where content is organized and easily accessible.

## Is this book for me?

Well, if you are an absolute beginner and you are starting from zero probably this is not the best book to start with because it lacks the basic knowledge about the instrument (hopefully it will be added with time).

However, you don't need that much experience and you can also start as an absolute beginner (feedbacks on this are welcomed) as a lot of exercises are basics and gradually increase in difficulty.

As I have mentioned before, this is the attempt to write down everything I think it is useful to learn and improve guitar playing while I am actually learning it after some years of playing. I am not personally starting from zero, but I think that you can make it from little to no past experience as I am not a professional player :grinning:. In the end I am only a full-time worker, father, husband, that can only afford to play 5/6 hours a week with a self-paced learning program that I have decided to build for myself and all the other people out there.

## How to use this book

You can read this book as you prefer. I don't suggest to use it linearly from start to finish, but I would instead focus on a couple of techniques/sections in each session, building up gradually. But you can use it as you think it is better for you.

The best strategy is to build a practice routine using the exercises in this book. I will try to give some ideas in a specific section of the book, but if you want to contribute on this, you are more than welcome.

Another suggestion I would like to give is to **always use a metronome**. Start slow, then clean the execution and start building speed once you have mastered that tempo.
Try to push yourself and then come back a little to clean up.
Everybody wants to play fast (at the beginning at least), but that requires a lot of discipline and hard work: be patient.
If you don't have a metronome try to use your foot to beat the tempo as precisely as possible, or try to sing in your mind the beat.

There are many ways you can contribute to this project:

1. The **easiest way** is to create a new issue, by indicating with labels:
   - a *bug* in case of errors, typos or grammar problems
   - a *feature request* for new chapters, missing arguments
   - an *issue* for all the other subjects and questions :question:
2. The other way is to open a pull request (for expert users)

## Where is the book?

As mentioned in the Structure section, in this repository there is only the "source" code of the book.
I will update the project with a mini website of the project, an online web application where you can download pdf version and mp3 files of the tabs.

Right now the only option to get the book is to:

## Build the book yourself

I have a software engineering background, so that's why I am using this space for hosting a guitar training book.
You can build the book by yourself (please respect the LICENSE), by using the python script under the "./script" folder.

This script will create all the .xml, .pdf and .mp3 files.

The prerequisites are:

- Having MuseScore installed
- libjack installed (use homebrew: brew install jack)
- Using macOS (tested on Catalina and BigSur)
- Having Python installed on your pc (2.7.8 at least)
